        <p>At Droom, we’ll help find the job that’s best for you. All you have to do is set up an account, go to your
          job-listings page and “like” the jobs that are best suited for you. Based on your profile, a company can
          determine whether or not you are a great fit with their company. If they believe you are, then you and that
          company will be matched.</p><br />
        <p>From there, the employer can message you about possibly setting up an interview and proceeding to the hiring
          process.</p><br />
        <p>We also work with companies to match them with the job-seeker that best match their ideal candidate.</p>
